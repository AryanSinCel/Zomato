Zomato App
==========

Overview
--------

The Zomato App is a SwiftUI-based food delivery application that allows users to browse restaurants, view menus, and place orders. The app integrates Core Data for authentication, ensuring that users can explore the app freely but must log in before adding items to the cart. This Project is just to enhance and apply my Swift UI skills in picture.
